Put all the folders in $ANDROID_SOURCE/external folder and build. AndroidVncServer executable would be build with the OS.


Issues : 

	This is currently View-Only. It uses uinput.ko for managing inputs. It can recieve inputs through VNC connection, but is not able to inject them into system.
	
	 Need to build uinput.ko kernel module. But even with that, inputs currently don't work.
